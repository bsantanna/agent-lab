## What's Agent-Lab?

Agent-Lab is a robust toolkit specifically engineered for the development and rigorous testing of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It highlights key features that streamline this process, including a REST API for managing interactions, relational persistence with PostgreSQL for data storage, and secure secrets management using Vault. Furthermore, Agent-Lab emphasizes observability through OpenTelemetry for detailed insights and leverages PgVector for efficient vector storage and search, ultimately offering a comprehensive platform for building and evaluating LLM-powered agents.

---

## Project Goals

- Deliver a comprehensive toolkit for the development, testing, and experimentation of LLM agents including example implementations.
- Offer MCP server interface for agent discovery, dialog history, and agent-to-agent communication.
- Offer first-class integration testing support to ensure quality assurance.
- Support Observability for responsible AI explainability and agent evaluation.
- Leverage a cloud-native architecture for seamless deployment and scalability.

---

## Key Features:

- **REST API**: Effortlessly manage integrations with LLMs, agents, and conversation history.
- **MCP Server**: A Model Control Protocol (MCP) server for agent discovery, dialog history, and agent-to-agent communication.
- **Cloud-Native**: Optimized for cloud environments with Docker, Kubernetes, and [Helm charts](doc/CHARTS.md) for streamlined deployment.
- **Relational Persistence**: Reliable data storage using PostgreSQL for prompts, agent-specific settings, and conversations.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely store and retrieve secrets with [Vault](doc/VAULT.md).
- **ETL Pipelines**: Integrates external data sources and LLMs using [Apache Airflow](doc/DAGs.md) for orchestrating batch processing and data-preparation tasks.
- **Observability**: Gain detailed insights with logs, metrics, and traces powered by [OpenTelemetry](doc/OTEL.md).
  - Includes reference implementations for [Grafana](doc/otel/GRAFANA.md) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](doc/otel/OPENSEARCH.md).
- **Vector Storage and Search**: Efficiently handle vector data with PgVector for similarity search and retrieval.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensure reliability and correctness with a comprehensive [integration test suite](doc/TESTS.md).
