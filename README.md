## What is Agent-Lab?

Agent-Lab is a cloud-native toolkit for building, testing, and deploying LLM-powered autonomous agents. Think of it as a platform where you wire up different AI agent types (RAG, browser automation, voice memos, vision, multi-agent supervisors) and interact with them via a REST API.

It features relational persistence with PostgreSQL, secure secrets management using Vault, observability through OpenTelemetry, and PgVector for vector storage and similarity search.

---

## Overview

**Tech stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, LangChain/LangGraph, PostgreSQL (3 databases: relational, vectors via pgvector, LangGraph checkpoints), Redis for pub/sub, Keycloak for auth, Docker Compose for orchestration.

**Architecture** — Clean Architecture with Dependency Injection:
- **Interface** — FastAPI routers + MCP server
- **Services** — Business logic, agent implementations
- **Domain** — SQLAlchemy models, repository interfaces
- **Infrastructure** — DB, auth, metrics (OpenTelemetry)

All wiring lives in `agent_lab/core/container.py` via `dependency-injector`.

**Agent system** — Agents extend `WorkflowAgentBase` (which uses LangGraph state graphs). Each agent type lives under `agent_lab/services/agent_types/` and is registered in a registry. The hierarchy goes from simple (echo, adaptive RAG) to complex (coordinator-planner-supervisor multi-agent). Agents process messages, have configurable settings (Jinja2-templated prompts), and persist state in the checkpoints database.

**Testing** — Two layers:
- **Integration tests** spin up real infrastructure via testcontainers (Postgres, Redis, Keycloak, Ollama as an OpenAI-compatible embeddings mock, headless Chrome).
- **Simulation tests** use `langwatch-scenario` with LLM judges to evaluate agent behavior end-to-end.

**Deployment** — Ships with Helm charts (`charts/`) for Kubernetes and Terraform scripts (`terraform/`) for provisioning cloud infrastructure including databases, auth realms, and secrets. See [Setup guide](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md) for details.

## Project Principles

- Give researchers and developers everything they need to build, test, and experiment with LLM agents, with ready-to-use reference implementations.
- Expose an MCP server for agent discovery, conversation history, and agent-to-agent communication.
- Ship with integration and simulation test suites so every agent change is validated automatically.
- Provide full observability through logs, metrics, and traces for explainability and evaluation.
- Make it easy to create new custom agents by extending base classes and registering them in the agent registry.
- Run anywhere with a cloud-native architecture built for containerized deployment and horizontal scaling.

## Key Features

- **REST API**: Manage integrations with AI suppliers, LLMs settings, agents, and conversation histories with our [REST API](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/REST_API.md).
- **MCP Server**: Utilize the [Model Control Protocol (MCP) server](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/MCP.md) for agent discovery, dialog history, and agent-to-agent communication.
- **Observability**: Obtain detailed insights through logs, metrics, and traces powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/OTEL.md).
  - Includes reference implementations for [Grafana](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/otel/GRAFANA.md) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/otel/OPENSEARCH.md).
- **Cloud-Native**: Optimized for cloud environments with Docker, Kubernetes, and [Terraform scripts](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md) for streamlined deployment.
- **Relational Persistence**: Store data reliably using PostgreSQL to support the [entity domain model](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/DOMAIN.md) for prompts, agent-specific settings, conversations, and more.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely store and retrieve secrets with [Vault](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/VAULT.md).
- **Vector Storage and Search**: Efficiently manage vector data using PgVector for similarity search and retrieval.
- **Agent Memory**: Using PostgreSQL checkpointer to store and retrieve agent memory, enabling agents to maintain context across interactions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure reliability and correctness with a comprehensive [integration test suite](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/TESTS.md).

## MCP Server

Agent-Lab features a MCP Server that allows agent discovery (`get_agent_list` tool), dialog history (`get_message_list` tool) and agent-to-agent communication (`post_message` tool).

The following example shows MCP Server discovering and obtaining dialog history of a [supervised coder agent](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/notebooks/05_test_agent_type-multiagent-coder.ipynb) instance:

## Getting Started

Agent-Lab is designed for ease of setup and use, whether you're a developer building LLM agents or a researcher experimenting with agentic workflows.

Documentation in this repository is divided into two main sections:

- **Developer's Guide**: Tailored for developers who want to customize Agent-Lab or build agentic workflows. It includes setup instructions and development practices. Please refer to our [developer's guide](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/DEV_GUIDE.md).
- **Researcher's Guide**: Provides detailed instructions for researchers on setting up and using Agent-Lab, including how to run the MCP server, manage agents, conduct experiments, tune prompts, and prototype new agents. Please refer to our [researcher's guide](https://github.com/btech-software/agent-lab/blob/main/doc/RESEARCHER_GUIDE.md).

Please consult these guides for detailed instructions on getting started with Agent-Lab.
