## What's Agent-Lab?

Agent-Lab is a robust toolkit specifically engineered for the development and rigorous testing of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It highlights key features that streamline this process, including a REST API for managing interactions, relational persistence with PostgreSQL for data storage, and secure secrets management using Vault. Furthermore, Agent-Lab emphasizes observability through OpenTelemetry for detailed insights and leverages PgVector for efficient vector storage and search, ultimately offering a comprehensive platform for building and evaluating LLM-powered agents.

## Key Features:

- **REST API**: Seamlessly manage integrations with LLMs, agents, and messages
- **Relational Persistence**: Robust data storage with PostgreSQL
- **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and retrieval using Vault
- **Observability**: Detailed logs, metrics, and traces powered by OpenTelemetry
  - Reference implementations for Grafana and OpenSearch
- **Vector Storage and Search**: Efficient vector handling with PgVector
