## What's Agent-Lab?

Agent-Lab is a robust toolkit specifically engineered for the development and rigorous testing of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It highlights key features that streamline this process, including a REST API for managing interactions, relational persistence with PostgreSQL for data storage, and secure secrets management using Vault. Furthermore, Agent-Lab emphasizes observability through OpenTelemetry for detailed insights and leverages PgVector for efficient vector storage and search, ultimately offering a comprehensive platform for building and evaluating LLM-powered agents.
