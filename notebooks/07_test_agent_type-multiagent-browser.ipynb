It's when smart people use numbers and math formulas to figure out money problems. There are two main ways people use this math with money: First, they figure out how much certain money deals (like special contracts) should cost. Second, they use math to help people decide how to invest their money safely and make the best choices about where to put their money so they don't lose it.\n\n**Key changes made:**\n- Replaced \"field of applied mathematics\" with \"using math to understand money\"\n- Explained \"mathematical modeling\" as \"using numbers and math formulas to figure out money problems\"\n- Simplified \"derivatives pricing\" to \"figure out how much certain money deals should cost\"\n- Changed \"risk and portfolio management\" to \"help people invest their money safely and make the best choices\"\n- Used shorter, simpler sentences\n- Removed technical jargon like \"quantitative finance\" and \"advanced quantitative techniques\""
