It has other names too, like \"quantitative finance\" (which just means using numbers and math to study finance) and \"financial mathematics.\" \n\nBasically, it's when really smart people use math equations and formulas to figure out things like:\n- How much money you might make or lose when you invest\n- How much things will cost in the future\n- How banks and companies should handle their money\n\nThink of it like this: if regular math helps you figure out how much change you'll get at the store, mathematical finance uses much more complicated math to help grown-ups make smart decisions about really big amounts of money - like when banks decide who to lend money to, or when companies try to predict if their stock prices will go up or down.\n\nIt's basically using math as a tool to solve money puzzles!"

It highlights two main areas that use advanced math: pricing financial contracts that depend on other assets (derivatives) and managing risk and investments (portfolio management). It is also known as quantitative finance and financial mathematics.\n\nKey findings\n- Also known as: quantitative finance and financial mathematics.\n- Field type: a branch of applied mathematics.\n- Core activity: mathematical modeling in finance.\n- Two main areas requiring advanced math:\n  - Derivatives pricing (how much complex financial contracts should cost).\n  - Risk and portfolio management (assessing and managing investment risk).\n\nDetailed analysis\n- Simplified restatement for a younger audience:\n  - Mathematical finance uses math to understand money and markets.\n  - It focuses on two big problems that need strong math: figuring out the price of contracts based on assets (like options) and deciding how to handle risk and build investment portfolios.\n\nConclusions and recommendations\n- This summary captures the first paragraph in plain language suitable for a 12-year-old.\n- For a fuller understanding, additional sections of the article should be consulted; information beyond the first paragraph was not provided here.\n- Source: Wikipedia, Mathematical finance (first paragraph)."
