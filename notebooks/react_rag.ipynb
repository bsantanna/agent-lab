    "\n",
    "Objective of this notebook is evaluating and adapting the implementation of [ReAct Agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/) with retrieval evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparation steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before executing the notebook perform the following preparation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start Docker containers: `docker compose up -d --build`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Verify application is up and running, with web browser: `http://localhost:18000/docs`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside project root directory, create a `.env` file with env vars with correct values:\n",

Moltke\\u2019s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]\\n\\nThus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy\\u2019s plans;\\n---\\nNeither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \\\"Well done!\\\"\\n\\n[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \\\"To plan secretly, to move surreptitiously, to foil the enemy\\u2019s intentions and balk his schemes, so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\\\" Sun Tz\\u016d reserves his approbation for things that\\n\\n\\\"the world\\u2019s coarse thumb And finger fail to plumb.\\\"\\n\\nTo lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\\n---\\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.\\n\\nTo see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.\\n---\\nThe Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.\\n---\\n[Literally, \\\"hides under the ninth earth,\\\" which is a metaphor indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may not know his whereabouts.\\\"]\\n\\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.\\n\\n[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the opinion of most of the commentators.]\\n---\\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\\n\\nHence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.\\n\\n[A \\\"counsel of perfection\\\" as Tu Mu truly observes. \\\"Position\\\" need not be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to increase the safety of his army.]\\n---\\nThe consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.\\n\\nIn respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\\n\\nMeasurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.</context>\",\n",

Moltke\\u2019s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]\\n\\nThus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy\\u2019s plans;\\n---\\nNeither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, \\\"Well done!\\\"\\n\\n[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \\\"To plan secretly, to move surreptitiously, to foil the enemy\\u2019s intentions and balk his schemes, so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\\\" Sun Tz\\u016d reserves his approbation for things that\\n\\n\\\"the world\\u2019s coarse thumb And finger fail to plumb.\\\"\\n\\nTo lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\\n---\\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.\\n\\nTo see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.\\n---\\nThe Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.\\n---\\n[Literally, \\\"hides under the ninth earth,\\\" which is a metaphor indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may not know his whereabouts.\\\"]\\n\\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.\\n\\n[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the opinion of most of the commentators.]\\n---\\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\\n\\nHence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.\\n\\n[A \\\"counsel of perfection\\\" as Tu Mu truly observes. \\\"Position\\\" need not be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to increase the safety of his army.]\\n---\\nThe consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.\\n\\nIn respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\\n\\nMeasurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.</context>\",\n",
