Thus, Thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it, even for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.: \\\"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is nothing better than a narrow pass.\\\" When Lu Kuang was returning from his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far as I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch’in, plotted against him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han, governor of Kao-ch’ang, counseled him, saying: \\\"Lu Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan.

Chang Yu reminds us that the saying only applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in numbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline.]\\n\\nif quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.\\n\\nHence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\\n\\nNow the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.\\n\\n[As Li Ch’uan tersely puts it: \\\"Gap indicates deficiency; if the general’s ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed in his profession), his army will lack strength.\\\"]\\n\\nThere are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:—\\n\\n(1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.\\n\\n[Li Ch’uan adds the comment: \\\"It is like tying together the legs of a thoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\\\" One would naturally think of \\\"the ruler\\\" in this passage as being at home, and trying to direct the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T’ai Kung: \\\"A kingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be directed from within.\\\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement, or when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong orders.]\\n\\n(2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.\\n\\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is, freely translated: \\\"The military sphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can’t handle an army in kid gloves.\\\" And Chang Yu says: \\\"Humanity and justice are the principles on which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility, on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate the governing of an army\\\"—to that of a State, understood.]\\n\\n(3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\\n\\n[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\\n\\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\\n\\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch’en here. The other commentators refer not to the ruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu says: \\\"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he must not be entrusted with a position of authority.\\\" Tu Mu quotes: \\\"The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man has no fear of death.\\\"]\\n\\nBut when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.\\n\\nThus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. \\n\\n User query: Explain what is the pinnacle of skill according to the Art of War Book\"\n",

She had built the Great Wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube.

Thus, Po Ch’i stands out conspicuous in the period when Ch’in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch’in dynasty are illuminated by the transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts’ao Ts’ao dominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T’ang dynasty, one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T’ai Tsung) was seconded by the brilliant strategy of Li Ching.

It is such an uncommon thing to find any of the literati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it worth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view is upheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch’ien, shows that for all his ardent admiration of Confucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any price:—\\n\\nMilitary weapons are the means used by the Sage to punish violence and cruelty, to give peace to troublous times, to remove difficulties and dangers, and to succour those who are in peril. Every animal with blood in its veins and horns on its head will fight when it is attacked. How much more so will man, who carries in his breast the faculties of love and hatred, joy and anger! When he is pleased, a feeling of affection springs up within him; when angry, his poisoned sting is brought into play. That is the natural law which governs his being…. What then shall be said of those scholars of our time, blind to all great issues, and without any appreciation of relative values, who can only bark out their stale formulas about \\\"virtue\\\" and \\\"civilization,\\\" condemning the use of military weapons? They will surely bring our country to impotence and dishonour and the loss of her rightful heritage; or, at the very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion, sacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse to modify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in the family the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot be dispensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be allowed to fall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that this power will be exercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and that among those who bear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.

Her long military annals stretch back to a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the centralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\n\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can point with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most fateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch’i stands out conspicuous in the period when Ch’in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch’in dynasty are illuminated by the transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts’ao Ts’ao dominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T’ang dynasty, one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T’ai Tsung) was seconded by the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with the greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\n\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzŭ downwards, and especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form.

[1] ]\\n\\nBy holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.\\n\\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to defend.]\\n\\nIf the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\\n\\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch’en’s interpretation of I. § 23.]\\n\\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.\\n\\nAppear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.\\n\\nAn army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.\\n\\n[Ts’ao Kung sums up very well: \\\"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \\\"a bolt from the blue\\\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are defended, attack in unexpected quarters.\\\"]\\n\\nYou can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.\\n\\n[Wang Hsi explains \\\"undefended places\\\" as \\\"weak points; that is to say, where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst themselves.\\\"]\\n\\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.\\n\\n[I.e., where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later clause. Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch’en assume the meaning to be: \\\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend even those places that are not likely to be attacked;\\\" and Tu Mu adds: \\\"How much more, then, those that will be attacked.\\\" Taken thus, however, the clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \\\"He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\\\"]\\n\\nHence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack.\\n\\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.] \\n\\n User query: Explain what is the pinnacle of skill according to the Art of War Book\"\n",

Thus, Thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it, even for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.: \\\"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is nothing better than a narrow pass.\\\" When Lu Kuang was returning from his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far as I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch’in, plotted against him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han, governor of Kao-ch’ang, counseled him, saying: \\\"Lu Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan. Let us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass, thus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a stand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer.

WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\\\\n\\\\n[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows: \\\"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the defensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect methods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of attack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect methods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods before proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use of direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the perception of weak and strong points depends again on the above methods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on Energy.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nSun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.\\\\n\\\\n[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all. [1] ]\\\\n\\\\nBy holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.\\\\n\\\\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to defend.]\\\\n\\\\nIf the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\\\\n\\\\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch’en’s interpretation of I. § 23.]\\\\n\\\\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.\\\\n\\\\nAppear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.\\\\n\\\\nAn army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.\\\\n\\\\n[Ts’ao Kung sums up very well: \\\"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \\\"a bolt from the blue\\\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are defended, attack in unexpected quarters.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nYou can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.\\\\n\\\\n[Wang Hsi explains \\\"undefended places\\\" as \\\"weak points; that is to say, where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst themselves.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.\\\\n\\\\n[I.e., where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later clause. Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch’en assume the meaning to be: \\\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend even those places that are not likely to be attacked;\\\" and Tu Mu adds: \\\"How much more, then, those that will be attacked.\\\" Taken thus, however, the clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \\\"He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nHence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack.\\\\n\\\\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]'), Document(id='c505c08a-18d7-464d-9e1f-6f1ee83cc64f', metadata={'source': 'tests/integration/sun_tzu_the_art_of_war.zip.md'}, page_content='The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months;\\\\n\\\\n[It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as \\\"mantlets\\\", described. Ts’ao Kung simply defines them as \\\"large shields,\\\" but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch’uan, who says they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman testudo, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch’en Hao. See supra II. 14. The name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the \\\"movable shelters\\\" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators. They were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled from within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called \\\"wooden donkeys.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.\\\\n\\\\n[These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of the enemy’s walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence, and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note.]\\\\n\\\\nThe general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants,\\\\n\\\\n[This vivid simile of Ts’ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready.]\\\\n\\\\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.\\\\n\\\\n[We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]\\\\n\\\\nTherefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\\\\n\\\\n[Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed \\\"Father and mother of the people.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nWith his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.\\\\n\\\\n[Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: \\\"And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.\\\\n\\\\nIt is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;\\\\n\\\\n[Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]\\\\n\\\\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\\\\n\\\\n[Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts’ao Kung, however, gives a clue to Sun Tzŭ’s meaning: \\\"Being two to the enemy’s one, we may use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.\\\" Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: \\\"If our force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall upon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed from behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front.\\\" This is what is meant by saying that ‘one part may be used in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.’ Tu Mu does not understand that dividing one’s army is simply an irregular, just as concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too hasty in calling this a mistake.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nIf equally matched, we can offer battle;')]\"\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The concept of \\\"desperate ground\\\" or \\\"difficult terrain\\\" in military strategy refers to a situation where an army finds itself in a position from which it cannot easily retreat. This type of terrain forces the army to fight with determination because there is no viable option for withdrawal.\\n\\nIn the context of Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*, difficult terrain is one of several types of ground that can influence military strategy and tactics. Here are some key points about desperate or difficult ground:\\n\\n1. **No Retreat Option**: When an army is on desperate ground, it has its back to a natural barrier such as a river, mountain, or cliff, making retreat impossible.\\n\\n2. **Fight with Determination**: Because there is no way out except through the enemy lines, soldiers are compelled to fight with extreme resolve and bravery. This can be both an advantage (increased morale) and a disadvantage (if morale breaks, it can lead to total defeat).\\n\\n3. **Strategic Considerations**: Commanders must carefully consider the implications of operating in such terrain. They need to ensure that their forces are well-prepared and motivated since there is no fallback position.\\n\\n4. **Historical Examples**: Throughout history, many battles have been fought on desperate ground, often leading to decisive victories or defeats. For example, the Battle of Cannae (216 BC) involved Hannibal's forces being surrounded by the Roman army but ultimately defeating them due to superior tactics and strategy.\\n\\n5. **Modern Relevance**: In modern warfare, the concept of desperate ground can be applied metaphorically to situations where an organization or a military force has no option but to fight on because they are cornered politically, economically, or militarily.\\n\\nUnderstanding these dynamics is crucial for strategic planning and decision-making in both historical and contemporary contexts. It highlights the importance of situational awareness, resource management, and tactical flexibility in warfare.\",\n",

Thus, Thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it, even for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.: \\\"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is nothing better than a narrow pass.\\\" When Lu Kuang was returning from his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far as I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch’in, plotted against him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han, governor of Kao-ch’ang, counseled him, saying: \\\"Lu Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan. Let us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass, thus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a stand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer.

WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\\\\n\\\\n[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows: \\\"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the defensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect methods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of attack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect methods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods before proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use of direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the perception of weak and strong points depends again on the above methods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on Energy.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nSun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.\\\\n\\\\n[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all. [1] ]\\\\n\\\\nBy holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.\\\\n\\\\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to defend.]\\\\n\\\\nIf the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\\\\n\\\\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch’en’s interpretation of I. § 23.]\\\\n\\\\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.\\\\n\\\\nAppear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.\\\\n\\\\nAn army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.\\\\n\\\\n[Ts’ao Kung sums up very well: \\\"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \\\"a bolt from the blue\\\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are defended, attack in unexpected quarters.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nYou can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.\\\\n\\\\n[Wang Hsi explains \\\"undefended places\\\" as \\\"weak points; that is to say, where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst themselves.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.\\\\n\\\\n[I.e., where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later clause. Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch’en assume the meaning to be: \\\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend even those places that are not likely to be attacked;\\\" and Tu Mu adds: \\\"How much more, then, those that will be attacked.\\\" Taken thus, however, the clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \\\"He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nHence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to attack.\\\\n\\\\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]'), Document(id='c505c08a-18d7-464d-9e1f-6f1ee83cc64f', metadata={'source': 'tests/integration/sun_tzu_the_art_of_war.zip.md'}, page_content='The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months;\\\\n\\\\n[It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as \\\"mantlets\\\", described. Ts’ao Kung simply defines them as \\\"large shields,\\\" but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch’uan, who says they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman testudo, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch’en Hao. See supra II. 14. The name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the \\\"movable shelters\\\" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators. They were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled from within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called \\\"wooden donkeys.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.\\\\n\\\\n[These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of the enemy’s walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence, and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note.]\\\\n\\\\nThe general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants,\\\\n\\\\n[This vivid simile of Ts’ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready.]\\\\n\\\\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.\\\\n\\\\n[We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]\\\\n\\\\nTherefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\\\\n\\\\n[Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed \\\"Father and mother of the people.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nWith his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.\\\\n\\\\n[Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: \\\"And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.\\\\n\\\\nIt is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;\\\\n\\\\n[Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]\\\\n\\\\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\\\\n\\\\n[Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts’ao Kung, however, gives a clue to Sun Tzŭ’s meaning: \\\"Being two to the enemy’s one, we may use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.\\\" Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: \\\"If our force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall upon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed from behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front.\\\" This is what is meant by saying that ‘one part may be used in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.’ Tu Mu does not understand that dividing one’s army is simply an irregular, just as concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too hasty in calling this a mistake.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nIf equally matched, we can offer battle;')] \\n\\n LLM generation: The concept of \\\"desperate ground\\\" or \\\"difficult terrain\\\" in military strategy refers to a situation where an army finds itself in a position from which it cannot easily retreat. This type of terrain forces the army to fight with determination because there is no viable option for withdrawal.\\n\\nIn the context of Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*, difficult terrain is one of several types of ground that can influence military strategy and tactics. Here are some key points about desperate or difficult ground:\\n\\n1. **No Retreat Option**: When an army is on desperate ground, it has its back to a natural barrier such as a river, mountain, or cliff, making retreat impossible.\\n\\n2. **Fight with Determination**: Because there is no way out except through the enemy lines, soldiers are compelled to fight with extreme resolve and bravery. This can be both an advantage (increased morale) and a disadvantage (if morale breaks, it can lead to total defeat).\\n\\n3. **Strategic Considerations**: Commanders must carefully consider the implications of operating in such terrain.

That general, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was surrounded by a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D. The country was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force was soon in dire straits for want of water. The wells they bored ran dry, and the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the moisture. Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch’ing exclaimed: \\\"We are desperate men. Far better to die for our country than to go with fettered hands into captivity!\\\" A strong gale happened to be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense clouds of sandy dust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had abated before deciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer, Li Shou-cheng by name, was quicker to see an opportunity, and said: \\\"They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm our numbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the strenuous fighter, and the wind will be our best ally.\\\" Accordingly, Fu Yen-ch’ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his cavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to safety.]\\n\\nSuch is the art of warfare.\\n\\n[1] See Col.

But the commentators understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T’ai Kung: \\\"A kingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be directed from within.\\\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement, or when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong orders.]\\n\\n(2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.\\n\\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is, freely translated: \\\"The military sphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can’t handle an army in kid gloves.\\\" And Chang Yu says: \\\"Humanity and justice are the principles on which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility, on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate the governing of an army\\\"—to that of a State, understood.]\\n\\n(3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\\n\\n[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\\n\\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\\n\\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch’en here. The other commentators refer not to the ruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu says: \\\"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he must not be entrusted with a position of authority.\\\" Tu Mu quotes: \\\"The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man has no fear of death.\\\"]\\n\\nBut when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.\\n\\nThus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. \\n\\n User query: What does Sun Tzu's \\\"The Art of War\\\" consider as the highest level of proficiency?\"\n",

Moreover, as we know that Wu Yuan and Po P’ei both took part in the expedition, and also that its success was largely due to the dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother, it is not easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part in the same campaign.\\n\\nCh’en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:—\\n\\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art.

The former lived only a century after the alleged date of Sun Tzŭ, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the Tso Chuan, which had been entrusted to him by its author.

Further proof of Sun Tzŭ’s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be extended, is given in the Hsu Lu; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected thereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui-hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the 13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing that he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that he would not have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly believed the contrary. And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated Chinaman will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is not far to seek. Thus in XIII. § 1, there is an unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which had already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in a modified form.

      "  \"document\": \"Apologies for War\\n\\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back to a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the centralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.\\n\\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom China can point with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond of emerging at the most fateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch’i stands out conspicuous in the period when Ch’in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy years which followed the break-up of the Ch’in dynasty are illuminated by the transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is tottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts’ao Ts’ao dominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T’ang dynasty, one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T’ai Tsung) was seconded by the brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear comparison with the greatest names in the military history of Europe.\\n\\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzŭ downwards, and especially as reflected in the standard literature of Confucianism, has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form.

Ch’ao Kung-wu accounts for it by saying: \\\"During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practice the art of war. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao’s rebellion came [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the vogue amongst all the high officials. Hence it is that the commentators of Sun Tzŭ in our dynasty belong mainly to that period. [47]\\n\\nBesides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work has not come down to us. The Sui Shu mentions four, namely Wang Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tzŭ); Chang Tzŭ-shang; Chia Hsu of Wei; [48] and Shen Yu of Wu. The T’ang Shu adds Sun Hao, and the T’ung Chih Hsiao Chi, while the T’u Shu mentions a Ming commentator, Huang Jun-yu. It is possible that some of these may have been merely collectors and editors of other commentaries, like Chi T’ien-pao and Chi Hsieh, mentioned above.\\n\\nAppreciations of Sun Tzŭ\\n\\nSun Tzŭ has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of China’s greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.), [49] Feng I (d. 34 A.D.), [50] Lu Meng (d. 219), [51] and Yo Fei (1103-1141). [52] The opinion of Ts’ao Kung, who disputes with Han Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded. [53] Still more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su Hsun (the father of Su Tung-p’o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of which owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzŭ. The following short passage by him is preserved in the Yu Hai: [54]—\\n\\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering, [55] is very different indeed from what other books tell us. [56] Wu Ch’i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they are linked together in popular speech as \\\"Sun and Wu.\\\" But Wu Ch’i’s remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzŭ’s work, where the style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.\\n\\nThe following is an extract from the \\\"Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature\\\" by Cheng Hou:—\\n\\nSun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all military men’s training, but also compel the most careful attention of scholars and men of letters. His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet profound, perspicuous and eminently practical. Such works as the Lun Yu, the I Ching and the great Commentary, [57] as well as the writings of Mencius, Hsun K’uang and Yang Chu, all fall below the level of Sun Tzŭ.\\n\\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the criticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says, \\\"encourages a ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism.\\\"\\n\\nApologies for War \\n\\n User query: What does Sun Tzu's \\\"The Art of War\\\" consider as the highest level of proficiency?\"\n",

      "  \"generation\": \"The concept of \\\"desperate ground\\\" or \\\"difficult terrain\\\" in military strategy refers to a situation where an army finds itself in a position from which it cannot easily retreat. This type of terrain forces the army to fight with determination because there is no viable option for withdrawal.\\n\\nIn the context of Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*, difficult terrain is one of several types of ground that can influence military strategy and tactics. Here are some key points about desperate or difficult ground:\\n\\n1. **No Retreat Option**: When an army is on desperate ground, it has its back to a natural barrier such as a river, mountain, or cliff, making retreat impossible.\\n\\n2. **Fight with Determination**: Because there is no way out except through the enemy lines, soldiers are compelled to fight with extreme resolve and bravery. This can be both an advantage (increased morale) and a disadvantage (if morale breaks, it can lead to total defeat).\\n\\n3. **Strategic Considerations**: Commanders must carefully consider the implications of operating in such terrain. They need to ensure that their forces are well-prepared and motivated since there is no fallback position.\\n\\n4. **Historical Examples**: Throughout history, many battles have been fought on desperate ground, often leading to decisive victories or defeats. For example, the Battle of Cannae (216 BC) involved Hannibal's forces being surrounded by the Roman army but ultimately defeating them due to superior tactics and strategy.\\n\\n5. **Modern Relevance**: In modern warfare, the concept of desperate ground can be applied metaphorically to situations where an organization or a military force has no option but to fight on because they are cornered politically, economically, or militarily.\\n\\nUnderstanding these dynamics is crucial for strategic planning and decision-making in both historical and contemporary contexts. It highlights the importance of situational awareness, resource management, and tactical flexibility in warfare.\",\n",

It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which date Yüeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted by its supreme effort against Ch’u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the tradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace. [33] We may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point the negative testimony of the Tso Chuan far outweighs any shred of authority still attaching to the Shih Chi, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from the great commentary. It was Wu Tzŭ-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s exploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\n\\nHow then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, [34] Po P’ei and Fu Kai?\"\n",

It was the best translation available for 50 years.

I did the conversion in complete ignorance of Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the conversion). Thus, I faced the difficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as much of the important text as I could. Every paraphrase represents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the text as possible.

Père Amiot appears to have enjoyed no small reputation as a sinologue in his day, and the field of his labours was certainly extensive.

      "  \"document\": \"who had served under the Yin.\\n\\n[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly doubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch’en appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \\\"I Yin and Lu Ya,\\\" he says, \\\"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not employ the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements were all for the good of the people.\\\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \\\"How should two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common spies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\\\" Ho Shih believes then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their supposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]\\n\\nHence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.\\n\\n[Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \\\"Just as water, which carries a boat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so reliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the cause of utter destruction.\\\"]\\n\\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army’s ability to move.\\n\\n[Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man without ears or eyes.]\\n\\n[1] \\\"Aids to Scouting,\\\" p. 2.\\n\\n[2] \\\"Marshal Turenne,\\\" p. 311.\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF WAR ***\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;\\n\\n[Literally, \\\"without form or sound,\\\" but it is said of course with reference to the enemy.]\\n\\nand hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.\\n\\nYou may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\\n\\nIf we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\\n\\n[Tu Mu says: \\\"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign himself.\\\" It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]\\n\\nIf we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.\\n\\n[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: \\\"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\\\" Li Ch’uan says: \\\"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\\\" and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p’ing and about to be attacked by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of \\\"bluff.\\\"]\\n\\nBy discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must be divided.\\n\\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei Yao-ch’en) rightly explains it thus: \\\"If the enemy’s dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from every quarter.\\\"]\\n\\nWe can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.\\n\\nAnd if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.\\n\\nThe spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points;\\n\\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by saying that \\\"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do, he was thinking most of what he was going to do himself.\\\"]\\n\\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\\n\\nFor should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak. \\n\\n User query: What is the ultimate skill or achievement that Sun Tzu describes in \\\"The Art of War\\\"?\"\n",

      "  \"document\": \"Chapter V. ENERGY\\n\\nSun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.\\n\\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin’s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \\\"How large an army do you think I could lead?\\\" \\\"Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty.\\\" \\\"And you?\\\" asked the Emperor. \\\"Oh!\\\" he answered, \\\"the more the better.\\\"]\\n\\nFighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.\\n\\nTo ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct and indirect.\\n\\n[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ’s treatise, the discussion of the cheng and the ch’i.\\\" As it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to render them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well to tabulate some of the commentators’ remarks on the subject before proceeding further. Li Ch’uan: \\\"Facing the enemy is cheng, making lateral diversion is ch’i. Chia Lin: \\\"In presence of the enemy, your troops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure victory abnormal manœuvers must be employed.\\\" Mei Yao-ch’en: \\\"Ch’i is active, cheng is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity, activity brings the victory itself.\\\" Ho Shih: \\\"We must cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed, and vice versa; thus cheng may also be ch’i, and ch’i may also be cheng.\\\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent. [Ch’ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told, the march on Lin-chin was cheng, and the surprise manœuver was ch’i.\\\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words: \\\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of ch’i and cheng. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: ‘Direct warfare favours frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts’ao Kung says: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect manœuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent.

Shih Chi mentions Sun Wu as general. 511 Another attack on Ch’u. 510 Wu makes a successful attack on Yüeh. This is the first war between the two states. 509 or 508 Ch’u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang. 506 Ho Lu attacks Ch’u with the aid of T’ang and Ts’ai. Decisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Ying. Last mention of Sun Wu in Shih Chi . 505 Yüeh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army. Wu is beaten by Ch’in and evacuates Ying. 504 Ho Lu sends Fu Ch’ai to attack Ch’u. 497 Kou Chien becomes King of Yüeh. 496 Wu attacks Yüeh, but is defeated by Kou Chien at Tsui-li. Ho Lu is killed. 494 Fu Ch’ai defeats Kou Chien in the great battle of Fu- chaio, and enters the capital of Yüeh. 485 or 484 Kou Chien renders homage to Wu. Death of Wu Tzŭ-hsu. 482 Kou Chien invades Wu in the absence of Fu Ch’ai. 478 to 476 Further attacks by Yüeh on Wu. 475 Kou Chien lays siege to the capital of Wu. 473 Final defeat and extinction of Wu.\\\\n\\\\nThe sentence quoted above from VI. § 21 hardly strikes me as one that could have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which date Yüeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted by its supreme effort against Ch’u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the tradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace. [33] We may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point the negative testimony of the Tso Chuan far outweighs any shred of authority still attaching to the Shih Chi, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from the great commentary. It was Wu Tzŭ-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s exploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\\\n\\\\nHow then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, [34] Po P’ei and Fu Kai?'), Document(id='74ca9ff7-6c35-46b5-98bb-d564f73264e9', metadata={'source': 'tests/integration/sun_tzu_the_art_of_war.zip.md'}, page_content='who had served under the Yin.\\\\n\\\\n[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly doubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch’en appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \\\"I Yin and Lu Ya,\\\" he says, \\\"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not employ the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements were all for the good of the people.\\\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \\\"How should two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common spies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\\\" Ho Shih believes then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their supposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]\\\\n\\\\nHence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.\\\\n\\\\n[Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \\\"Just as water, which carries a boat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so reliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the cause of utter destruction.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army’s ability to move.\\\\n\\\\n[Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man without ears or eyes.]\\\\n\\\\n[1] \\\"Aids to Scouting,\\\" p. 2.\\\\n\\\\n[2] \\\"Marshal Turenne,\\\" p. 311.\\\\n\\\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF WAR ***\\\\n\\\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.\\\\n\\\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;\\\\n\\\\n[Literally, \\\"without form or sound,\\\" but it is said of course with reference to the enemy.]\\\\n\\\\nand hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.\\\\n\\\\nYou may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\\\\n\\\\nIf we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\\\\n\\\\n[Tu Mu says: \\\"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign himself.\\\" It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]\\\\n\\\\nIf we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.\\\\n\\\\n[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: \\\"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\\\" Li Ch’uan says: \\\"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\\\" and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p’ing and about to be attacked by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of \\\"bluff.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nBy discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must be divided.\\\\n\\\\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei Yao-ch’en) rightly explains it thus: \\\"If the enemy’s dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from every quarter.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nWe can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.\\\\n\\\\nAnd if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.\\\\n\\\\nThe spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points;\\\\n\\\\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by saying that \\\"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do, he was thinking most of what he was going to do himself.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\\\\n\\\\nFor should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.'), Document(id='2954b961-d17c-416a-a9c0-b46c100ccf6d', metadata={'source': 'tests/integration/sun_tzu_the_art_of_war.zip.md'}, page_content='Chapter V. ENERGY\\\\n\\\\nSun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.\\\\n\\\\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin’s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \\\"How large an army do you think I could lead?\\\" \\\"Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty.\\\" \\\"And you?\\\" asked the Emperor. \\\"Oh!\\\" he answered, \\\"the more the better.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nFighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.\\\\n\\\\nTo ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct and indirect.\\\\n\\\\n[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ’s treatise, the discussion of the cheng and the ch’i.\\\" As it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to render them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well to tabulate some of the commentators’ remarks on the subject before proceeding further. Li Ch’uan: \\\"Facing the enemy is cheng, making lateral diversion is ch’i. Chia Lin: \\\"In presence of the enemy, your troops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure victory abnormal manœuvers must be employed.\\\" Mei Yao-ch’en: \\\"Ch’i is active, cheng is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity, activity brings the victory itself.\\\" Ho Shih: \\\"We must cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed, and vice versa; thus cheng may also be ch’i, and ch’i may also be cheng.\\\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent. [Ch’ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told, the march on Lin-chin was cheng, and the surprise manœuver was ch’i.\\\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words: \\\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of ch’i and cheng. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: ‘Direct warfare favours frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts’ao Kung says: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect manœuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: ‘In war, to march straight ahead is cheng; turning movements, on the other hand, are ch’i.’ These writers simply regard cheng as cheng, and ch’i as ch’i; they do not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on the T’ang Emperor T’ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: ‘A ch’i manœuver may be cheng, if we make the enemy look upon it as cheng; then our real attack will be ch’i, and vice versa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other operation is cheng, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed; whereas that is ch’i,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to be ch’i,\\\" it immediately becomes cheng.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nThat the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\\\n\\\\nIn all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\\\n\\\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding the enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect tactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.

Shih Chi mentions Sun Wu as general. 511 Another attack on Ch’u. 510 Wu makes a successful attack on Yüeh. This is the first war between the two states. 509 or 508 Ch’u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang. 506 Ho Lu attacks Ch’u with the aid of T’ang and Ts’ai. Decisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Ying. Last mention of Sun Wu in Shih Chi . 505 Yüeh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army. Wu is beaten by Ch’in and evacuates Ying. 504 Ho Lu sends Fu Ch’ai to attack Ch’u. 497 Kou Chien becomes King of Yüeh. 496 Wu attacks Yüeh, but is defeated by Kou Chien at Tsui-li. Ho Lu is killed. 494 Fu Ch’ai defeats Kou Chien in the great battle of Fu- chaio, and enters the capital of Yüeh. 485 or 484 Kou Chien renders homage to Wu. Death of Wu Tzŭ-hsu. 482 Kou Chien invades Wu in the absence of Fu Ch’ai. 478 to 476 Further attacks by Yüeh on Wu. 475 Kou Chien lays siege to the capital of Wu. 473 Final defeat and extinction of Wu.\\\\n\\\\nThe sentence quoted above from VI. § 21 hardly strikes me as one that could have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which date Yüeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted by its supreme effort against Ch’u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the tradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period 482-473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace. [33] We may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point the negative testimony of the Tso Chuan far outweighs any shred of authority still attaching to the Shih Chi, if once its other facts are discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from the great commentary. It was Wu Tzŭ-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s exploits, because the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\\\\n\\\\nHow then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown to its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well versed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on all the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, [34] Po P’ei and Fu Kai?'), Document(id='74ca9ff7-6c35-46b5-98bb-d564f73264e9', metadata={'source': 'tests/integration/sun_tzu_the_art_of_war.zip.md'}, page_content='who had served under the Yin.\\\\n\\\\n[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly doubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch’en appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \\\"I Yin and Lu Ya,\\\" he says, \\\"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not employ the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements were all for the good of the people.\\\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \\\"How should two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common spies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\\\" Ho Shih believes then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their supposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]\\\\n\\\\nHence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.\\\\n\\\\n[Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \\\"Just as water, which carries a boat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so reliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the cause of utter destruction.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army’s ability to move.\\\\n\\\\n[Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man without ears or eyes.]\\\\n\\\\n[1] \\\"Aids to Scouting,\\\" p. 2.\\\\n\\\\n[2] \\\"Marshal Turenne,\\\" p. 311.\\\\n\\\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF WAR ***\\\\n\\\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.\\\\n\\\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.

Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;\\\\n\\\\n[Literally, \\\"without form or sound,\\\" but it is said of course with reference to the enemy.]\\\\n\\\\nand hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.\\\\n\\\\nYou may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\\\\n\\\\nIf we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\\\\n\\\\n[Tu Mu says: \\\"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign himself.\\\" It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]\\\\n\\\\nIf we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.\\\\n\\\\n[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: \\\"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\\\" Li Ch’uan says: \\\"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\\\" and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p’ing and about to be attacked by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of \\\"bluff.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nBy discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must be divided.\\\\n\\\\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei Yao-ch’en) rightly explains it thus: \\\"If the enemy’s dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from every quarter.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nWe can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.\\\\n\\\\nAnd if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.\\\\n\\\\nThe spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points;\\\\n\\\\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by saying that \\\"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do, he was thinking most of what he was going to do himself.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\\\\n\\\\nFor should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.'), Document(id='2954b961-d17c-416a-a9c0-b46c100ccf6d', metadata={'source': 'tests/integration/sun_tzu_the_art_of_war.zip.md'}, page_content='Chapter V. ENERGY\\\\n\\\\nSun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.\\\\n\\\\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin’s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \\\"How large an army do you think I could lead?\\\" \\\"Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty.\\\" \\\"And you?\\\" asked the Emperor. \\\"Oh!\\\" he answered, \\\"the more the better.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nFighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.\\\\n\\\\nTo ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct and indirect.\\\\n\\\\n[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ’s treatise, the discussion of the cheng and the ch’i.\\\" As it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to render them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well to tabulate some of the commentators’ remarks on the subject before proceeding further. Li Ch’uan: \\\"Facing the enemy is cheng, making lateral diversion is ch’i. Chia Lin: \\\"In presence of the enemy, your troops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure victory abnormal manœuvers must be employed.\\\" Mei Yao-ch’en: \\\"Ch’i is active, cheng is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity, activity brings the victory itself.\\\" Ho Shih: \\\"We must cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed, and vice versa; thus cheng may also be ch’i, and ch’i may also be cheng.\\\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent. [Ch’ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told, the march on Lin-chin was cheng, and the surprise manœuver was ch’i.\\\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words: \\\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of ch’i and cheng. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: ‘Direct warfare favours frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts’ao Kung says: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation; appearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect manœuver.’ Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: ‘In war, to march straight ahead is cheng; turning movements, on the other hand, are ch’i.’ These writers simply regard cheng as cheng, and ch’i as ch’i; they do not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on the T’ang Emperor T’ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: ‘A ch’i manœuver may be cheng, if we make the enemy look upon it as cheng; then our real attack will be ch’i, and vice versa. The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.’\\\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other operation is cheng, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed; whereas that is ch’i,\\\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to be ch’i,\\\" it immediately becomes cheng.\\\"]\\\\n\\\\nThat the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\\\\n\\\\nIn all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\\\\n\\\\n[Chang Yu says: \\\"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding the enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\\\" A brilliant example of \\\"indirect tactics\\\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.

The provided excerpts focus on the effective management of forces, the importance of communication, and the use of direct and indirect maneuvers to achieve victory.\\n\\n#### Key Concepts\\n\\n1. **Control of Forces:**\\n   - Managing both large and small armies involves dividing them into smaller units with clear leadership.\\n   - Effective division ensures better control and coordination during battles.\\n\\n2. **Signals and Communication:**\\n   - Clear signs and signals are crucial for maintaining cohesion under attack.\\n   - Proper communication helps in coordinating movements and responses, preventing the army from breaking under pressure.\\n\\n3. **Direct and Indirect Maneuvers (Cheng and Ch'i):**\\n   - **Cheng (直):** Direct confrontation or straightforward attack. It involves normal array facing the enemy.\\n   - **Ch’i (奇):** Indirect maneuvers or lateral diversions. These are surprise attacks from unexpected quarters designed to confuse the enemy.\\n\\n#### Examples and Commentaries\\n\\n- **Han Hsin’s Strategy:**\\n  - Han Hsin's tactic of marching against Lin-chin while secretly moving forces across the Yellow River exemplifies ch’i. This deception caught the enemy off guard, securing victory through indirect tactics.\\n\\n- **Tang Emperor T’ai Tsung’s Insight:**\\n  - The emperor noted that any maneuver can become cheng or ch’i depending on how the enemy perceives it. Confusing the enemy about your real intent is crucial for successful strategy.\\n\\n#### Impact and Strategy\\n\\n- **Grindstone vs. Egg Analogy:**\\n  - Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of a decisive impact, likening an army’s effectiveness to a grindstone crushing an egg. This highlights the need for concentrated power and strategic targeting.\\n\\n- **Weak Points and Strong:**\\n  - Understanding weak points (ch’i) and strong points (cheng) is essential for victory. Direct tactics can be used initially, but indirect maneuvers are necessary for surprising and defeating the enemy.\\n\\n#### Practical Applications\\n\\n1. **Military Strategy:**\\n   - Commanders must understand cheng and ch’i to adapt their strategies based on enemy reactions.\\n   - Blending direct and indirect tactics makes it difficult for opponents to predict moves, leading to decisive victories.\\n\\n2. **Leadership:**\\n   - Clear communication and division of tasks are vital for maintaining a cohesive force under pressure.\\n   - Effective leadership involves ensuring that all units understand their roles and can respond quickly to changes in the battlefield.\\n\\n3. **Psychological Warfare:**\\n   - Confusing the enemy through deceptive maneuvers is a powerful psychological tool.\\n   - By making it difficult for the opponent to discern your real intentions, you gain a strategic advantage.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nSun Tzu’s teachings in \\\"The Art of War\\\" offer profound insights into strategic thinking and adaptability. The concepts of cheng and ch’i provide a framework for understanding how to use both straightforward and surprising tactics to outmaneuver the enemy. These principles are not only applicable in military contexts but also in business, politics, and personal strategies where adaptability and psychological warfare can lead to success.\\n\\nBy mastering these strategies, leaders can achieve decisive victories by anticipating and adapting to their opponents' moves, ensuring that their forces remain cohesive and effective under pressure.\",\n",

Here’s a summary and analysis of the key points:\\n\\n### Chapter V: Energy\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n1. **Control of Forces:** Managing a large army is similar to managing a small one; it involves dividing forces into smaller units with subordinate officers in command.\\n2. **Signs and Signals:** Effective communication through signs and signals ensures that a large host can withstand enemy attacks without breaking.\\n3. **Direct and Indirect Maneuvers (Cheng and Ch'i):** These are crucial for maintaining the army's cohesion under attack:\\n   - **Cheng (直):** Direct confrontation, straightforward attack, or normal array facing the enemy.\\n   - **Ch’i (奇):** Indirect maneuvers, lateral diversions, surprise attacks from unexpected quarters.\\n\\n**Examples and Commentaries:**\\n- **Han Hsin’s Example:** Han Hsin’s strategy of marching ostensibly against Lin-chin while secretly moving forces across the Yellow River in wooden tubs is cited as an example of ch’i.\\n- **Tang Emperor T’ai Tsung’s Insight:** The emperor's commentary highlights that any maneuver can become cheng or ch'i depending on how the enemy perceives it, emphasizing the importance of confusing the enemy.\\n\\n**Impact and Strategy:**\\n- **Grindstone vs. Egg Analogy:** The impact of an army should be like a grindstone against an egg—crushing and decisive.\\n- **Weak Points and Strong:** Understanding weak points (ch’i) and strong points (cheng) is essential for victory, involving both direct and indirect tactics.\\n\\n### General Strategy\\n\\n**Key Concepts:**\\n1. **Dividing Forces:** Effective division of troops into manageable units with clear leadership ensures better control.\\n2. **Signals and Communication:** Clear signals are vital to maintain cohesion under attack.\\n3. **Direct vs. Indirect Maneuvers:** Direct confrontations (cheng) can be used for initial engagements, but indirect tactics (ch’i) are necessary for securing victory by surprising the enemy.\\n\\n**Historical Examples:**\\n- **Lord Roberts' Night March:** An example of successful indirect tactics during the second Afghan war.\\n- **Han Hsin’s Deception:** Illustrates how a direct march can mask an indirect and surprising maneuver.\\n\\n### Practical Applications\\n\\n1. **Military Strategy:** Understanding cheng and ch’i allows commanders to adapt their strategies based on enemy reactions, making it difficult for the opponent to predict moves.\\n2. **Leadership:** Clear communication and division of tasks are essential for maintaining a cohesive force under pressure.\\n3. **Psychological Warfare:** Confusing the enemy by blending direct and indirect tactics can lead to decisive victories.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nSun Tzu’s teachings in \\\"The Art of War\\\" emphasize adaptability, clear communication, and psychological warfare as key components of successful military strategy. The concepts of cheng and ch’i provide a framework for understanding how to use both straightforward and surprising tactics to outmaneuver the enemy. These principles can be applied not only in military contexts but also in business, politics, and personal strategies where adaptability and deceptive maneuvers are crucial.\"\n",
