## Introduction

Agent-Lab provides a Helm chart to deploy the application on Kubernetes clusters. This chart is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to configure various aspects of the deployment.

In this document, we will cover a example deployment of Agent-Lab by on Kubernetes using the provided Helm chart.

**Note**: In this reference documentation, a [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) cluster is used, in a real scenario you should use a production-ready Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup Dependencies

### Setup Kubernetes Cluster with Minikube

This section describes how to setup a Kubernetes cluster with the necessary resources for running Agent-Lab and its dependencies.

1. Minikube cluster with sufficient resources. The following command allocates 6GB of memory and 4 CPUs to the Minikube VM:

```bash
minikube start --memory=6g --cpus=4
```

2. Enable the Ingress addon to allow external access to the services:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### Setup Certificate Manager

To manage TLS certificates, we will use the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). This tool automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.

1. Add Jetstack's Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```

2. Install cert-manager using Helm:

```bash
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.17.2 \
  --set crds.enabled=true
```

3. Create a ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt staging environment:

Next step is creating a ClusterIssuer resource that will be used to issue certificates from Let's Encrypt. 
Please replace `<your_email_address>` with your actual email address to receive notifications about certificate expiration and issues.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: <your_email_address>
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
EOF
```
