## Grafana reference implementation

The reference implementation of Grafana observability is available in the `otel/grafana` directory.

These settings are used by the `compose-graphana.yaml` file to start the application with Grafana observability.

**Note:** This implementation is just a reference and should not be used in production as it has no security settings.
