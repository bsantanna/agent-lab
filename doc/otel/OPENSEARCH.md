## OpenSearch Dashboards reference implementation
The reference implementation of OpenSearch Dashboards observability is available in the `otel/opensearch` directory.

These settings are used by the `compose-opensearch.yaml` file to start the application with OpenSearch Dashboards observability.

**Note:** This implementation is just a reference and should not be used in production as it has no security settings.
