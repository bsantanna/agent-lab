## Environment Setup

### Create a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Copy the example environment file
Copy the example environment file to `.env` and adjust the settings as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run tests

Run the tests to make sure everything is working as expected:

```bash
make test
```

### Initialize pre-commit

If you plan to contribute to the codebase, it is recommended to install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
